# 
# Given a 2-dimensional `grid` of integers, each value in the grid represents
# the color of the grid square at that location.
# 
# Two squares belong to the same _connected component_ if and only if they have
# the same color and are next to each other in any of the 4 directions.
# 
# The  _border_ of a connected component is all the squares in the connected
# component that are either 4-directionally adjacent to a square not in the
# component, or on the boundary of the grid (the first or last row or column).
# 
# Given a square at location `(r0, c0)` in the grid and a `color`, color the
# border of the connected component of that square with the given `color`, and
# return the final `grid`.
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: grid = [[1,1],[1,2]], r0 = 0, c0 = 0, color = 3
#     Output: [[3, 3], [3, 2]]
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: grid = [[1,2,2],[2,3,2]], r0 = 0, c0 = 1, color = 3
#     Output: [[1, 3, 3], [2, 3, 3]]
#     
# 
# **Example 3:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: grid = [[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]], r0 = 1, c0 = 1, color = 2
#     Output: [[2, 2, 2], [2, 1, 2], [2, 2, 2]]
# 
# 
# 
# **Note:**
# 
#   1. `1 <= grid.length <= 50`
#   2. `1 <= grid[0].length <= 50`
#   3. `1 <= grid[i][j] <= 1000`
#   4. `0 <= r0 < grid.length`
#   5. `0 <= c0 < grid[0].length`
#   6. `1 <= color <= 1000`
#
