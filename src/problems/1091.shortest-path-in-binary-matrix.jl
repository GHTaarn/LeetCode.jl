# 
# In an N by N square grid, each cell is either empty (0) or blocked (1).
# 
# A  _clear  path from top-left to bottom-right_ has length `k` if and only if
# it is composed of cells `C_1, C_2, ..., C_k` such that:
# 
#   * Adjacent cells `C_i` and `C_{i+1}` are connected 8-directionally (ie., they are different and share an edge or corner)
#   * `C_1` is at location `(0, 0)` (ie. has value `grid[0][0]`)
#   * `C_k` is at location `(N-1, N-1)` (ie. has value `grid[N-1][N-1]`)
#   * If `C_i` is located at `(r, c)`, then `grid[r][c]` is empty (ie. `grid[r][c] == 0`).
# 
# Return the length of the shortest such clear path from top-left to bottom-
# right.  If such a path does not exist, return -1.
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: [[0,1],[1,0]]
#     ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/08/04/example1_1.png)
#     
#     Output: 2

# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: [[0,0,0],[1,1,0],[1,1,0]]
#     ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/08/04/example2_1.png)
#     
#     Output: 4

#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Note:**
# 
#   1. `1 <= grid.length == grid[0].length <= 100`
#   2. `grid[r][c]` is `0` or `1`
