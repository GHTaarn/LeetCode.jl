# 
# You are given two arrays **(without duplicates)** `nums1` and `nums2` where
# `nums1`â€™s elements are subset of `nums2`. Find all the next greater numbers
# for `nums1`'s elements in the corresponding places of `nums2`.
# 
# The Next Greater Number of a number **x** in `nums1` is the first greater
# number to its right in `nums2`. If it does not exist, output -1 for this
# number.
# 
# **Example 1:**  
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: **nums1** = [4,1,2], **nums2** = [1,3,4,2].
#     Output: [-1,3,-1]
#     Explanation:
#         For number 4 in the first array, you cannot find the next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
#         For number 1 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the second array is 3.
#         For number 2 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**  
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: **nums1** = [2,4], **nums2** = [1,2,3,4].
#     Output: [3,-1]
#     Explanation:
#         For number 2 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the second array is 3.
#         For number 4 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
#     
# 
# **Note:**  
# 
#   1. All elements in `nums1` and `nums2` are unique.
#   2. The length of both `nums1` and `nums2` would not exceed 1000.
#
