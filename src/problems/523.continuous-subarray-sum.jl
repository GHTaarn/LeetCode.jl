# 
# Given a list of **non-negative** numbers and a target **integer** k, write a
# function to check if the array has a continuous subarray of size at least 2
# that sums up to a multiple of **k** , that is, sums up to n*k where n is also
# an **integer**.
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: [23, 2, 4, 6, 7],  k=6
#     Output: True
#     Explanation: Because [2, 4] is a continuous subarray of size 2 and sums up to 6.
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: [23, 2, 6, 4, 7],  k=6
#     Output: True
#     Explanation: Because [23, 2, 6, 4, 7] is an continuous subarray of size 5 and sums up to 42.
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Constraints:**
# 
#   * The length of the array won't exceed 10,000.
#   * You may assume the sum of all the numbers is in the range of a signed 32-bit integer.
