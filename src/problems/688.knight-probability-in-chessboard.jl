# 
# On an `N`x`N` chessboard, a knight starts at the `r`-th row and `c`-th column
# and attempts to make exactly `K` moves. The rows and columns are 0 indexed, so
# the top-left square is `(0, 0)`, and the bottom-right square is `(N-1, N-1)`.
# 
# A chess knight has 8 possible moves it can make, as illustrated below. Each
# move is two squares in a cardinal direction, then one square in an orthogonal
# direction.
# 
# 
# 
# ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/knight.png)
# 
# 
# 
# Each time the knight is to move, it chooses one of eight possible moves
# uniformly at random (even if the piece would go off the chessboard) and moves
# there.
# 
# The knight continues moving until it has made exactly `K` moves or has moved
# off the chessboard. Return the probability that the knight remains on the
# board after it has stopped moving.
# 
# 
# 
# **Example:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: 3, 2, 0, 0
#     Output: 0.0625
#     Explanation: There are two moves (to (1,2), (2,1)) that will keep the knight on the board.
#     From each of those positions, there are also two moves that will keep the knight on the board.
#     The total probability the knight stays on the board is 0.0625.
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Note:**
# 
#   * `N` will be between 1 and 25.
#   * `K` will be between 0 and 100.
#   * The knight always initially starts on the board.
