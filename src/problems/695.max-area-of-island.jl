# 
# Given a non-empty 2D array `grid` of 0's and 1's, an **island** is a group of
# `1`'s (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.)
# You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.
# 
# Find the maximum area of an island in the given 2D array. (If there is no
# island, the maximum area is 0.)
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
#      [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
#      [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
#      [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0, **1** ,0, **1** ,0,0],
#      [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0, **1** , **1** , **1** ,0,0],
#      [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0, **1** ,0,0],
#      [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
#      [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
#     
# 
# Given the above grid, return `6`. Note the answer is not 11, because the
# island must be connected 4-directionally.
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
# 
# Given the above grid, return `0`.
# 
# **Note:** The length of each dimension in the given `grid` does not exceed 50.
