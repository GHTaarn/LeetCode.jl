# Given the root node of a binary search tree (BST) and a value. You need to
# find the node in the BST that the node's value equals the given value. Return
# the subtree rooted with that node. If such node doesn't exist, you should
# return NULL.
# 
# For example,
# 
#     
#     
#     Given the tree:
#             4
#            / \
#           2   7
#          / \
#         1   3
#     
#     And the value to search: 2
#     
# 
# You should return this subtree:
# 
#     
#     
#           2     
#          / \   
#         1   3
#     
# 
# In the example above, if we want to search the value `5`, since there is no
# node with value `5`, we should return `NULL`.
# 
# Note that an empty tree is represented by `NULL`, therefore you would see the
# expected output (serialized tree format) as `[]`, not `null`.
#
