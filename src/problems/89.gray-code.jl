# 
# The gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in
# only one bit.
# 
# Given a non-negative integer _n_ representing the total number of bits in the
# code, print the sequence of gray code. A gray code sequence must begin with 0.
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input:  2
#     Output:  [0,1,3,2]
#     Explanation:
#     00 - 0
#     01 - 1
#     11 - 3
#     10 - 2
#     
#     For a given  _n_ , a gray code sequence may not be uniquely defined.
#     For example, [0,2,3,1] is also a valid gray code sequence.
#     
#     00 - 0
#     10 - 2
#     11 - 3
#     01 - 1
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input:  0
#     Output:  [0]
#     Explanation: We define the gray code sequence to begin with 0.
#                  A gray code sequence of _n_ has size = 2n, which for _n_ = 0 the size is 20 = 1.
#                  Therefore, for _n_ = 0 the gray code sequence is [0].
