# 
# A _full binary tree_  is a binary tree where each node has exactly 0 or 2
# children.
# 
# Return a list of all possible full binary trees with `N` nodes.  Each element
# of the answer is the root node of one possible tree.
# 
# Each `node` of each tree in the answer **must** have `node.val = 0`.
# 
# You may return the final list of trees in any order.
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: 7
#     Output: [[0,0,0,null,null,0,0,null,null,0,0],[0,0,0,null,null,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,null,null,null,null,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,null,null,0,0]]
